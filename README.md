## Other Useful Skills

  - Debugging: Whether it's just looking through the code for mistakes, or poring over a disassembled binary, I seem to have a knack for quickly figuring out what's going on and how to fix it.
  - Telecom & Communications: Professionally, I've installed & repaired fixed wireless systems, network bridges, residential and commercial networks, and worked on the relocation of CKVI-FM's broadcasting equipment.
  - Hardware: I've cooked up some homebrew circuits when necessary, I've torn apart hardware and modified it, I've repaired damaged traces. Still have a lot to learn, but I can figure things out when pressed.
  - Construction and Manual Labour: At work, I've wired houses for alarms, data, cctv, and television, I've constructed residential communication towers, laid conduit... the list goes on. On my own time, I've also done a bit of drywalling and painting where required.

## Hobbies and interests

 - Mostly computer stuff, to be honest. What can I say? I'm passionate about it. Even the stuff that most folks would find boring. Oh, and I might have a bit of an addiction to collecting Thinkpads.
 - Self-taught on guitar and bass, mostly just for noodling around when I feel like it.
 - Being brought up in an Italo-Canadian household, I do like making sausages, salami, and wine from scratch. You can always buy them at a store, but the homemade stuff hits different.
 - I keep trying to grow fruit trees from seed, but history show's I'm bloody terrible at it.
